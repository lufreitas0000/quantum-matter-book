\chapter{Connections, Curvature, and Gauge Theory}
\label{chap:connections_curvature}

Having established the basic language of manifolds and differential forms, we now introduce the central concepts of modern gauge theory: connections and curvature. These are the mathematical tools that describe how to compare vectors and fields at different points in a space, and they provide the universal language for describing forces in physics. We will see how electromagnetism is elegantly described as a U(1) gauge theory and how these same geometric structures can emerge in the low-energy description of complex condensed matter systems.
